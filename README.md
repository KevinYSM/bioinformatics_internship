## Project Title
Genetic analysis of skin melanoma metastases

## Supervisors
Prof. Jonas Nilsson and Dr. Joakim Karlsson

## Project description
To be added

## Project Goals
1. Perform and understand basic characterisation of RNA and exome sequences
2. Perform RNA and exome preprocessing workflow
3. Produce the following:
    - Point mutations graph (exome)
    - Copy number changes (left side) (exome)
    - Immune infiltration analysis (for RNA component)

## Extension
